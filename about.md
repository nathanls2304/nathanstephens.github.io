# About Me

I’m Nathan Stephens, a senior Aerospace Engineering student at Florida Institute of Technology with hands-on experience in dynamic systems modeling, simulation, controls, structural analysis, and product development. I specialize in solving complex engineering problems using a combination of analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and hardware-focused design. My work spans multiple domains, including aerospace, mechanical systems, and embedded software, allowing me to bridge the gap between simulation, design, and real-world implementation.

Core Technical Strengths:
- Dynamic Systems & Controls: modeling with quaternions, PID/Lyapunov control, system identification, actuator modeling
- Simulation & Analysis: CFD (ANSYS Fluent), FEA (ANSYS Mechanical), MATLAB/Simulink modeling, rapid prototyping workflows
- Mechanics & Design: structural analysis, materials selection, CAD (Creo, NX, Fusion 360), mechanism design
- Programming & Software: MATLAB, Simulink, C++; embedded systems; algorithm development
- Systems Engineering: requirements development, system architecture, multidisciplinary design reviews, trade studies

I enjoy tackling challenging technical problems, building practical solutions, and delivering designs that are functional, reliable, and backed by engineering analysis.
