My Journey Into Aerospace
My interest in aerospace began long ago. Growing up, I spent countless hours on flight simulators, flying everything from turboprops to wide-body jets, and even creating my own custom aircraft liveries. I would also occasionally visit the local airport or any nearby airport to planespot. That early curiosity gradually evolved into a passion for aerospace engineering.


Academic & Technical Growth
At Florida Institute of Technology, I’ve developed a strong foundation in aerodynamics, flight mechanics, and spacecraft systems through coursework, senior design projects, and independent simulations. My experience spans both atmospheric and space environments, including:
- Aerodynamics & CFD (subsonic, transonic, and rarefied regimes)
- Aircraft stability, control, and aerodynamic performance analysis
- Spacecraft ADCS & orbital mechanics
- Rocket nozzle design and compressible flow
- Structural analysis & lightweight design
- MATLAB/Simulink modeling, simulation, and verification
- CAD and rapid prototyping

Through these projects, I’ve learned to design systems from concept → analysis → prototyping → testing.


What I Enjoy Working On

I’m especially drawn to work at the intersection of aerodynamics, controls, and system design, including:
- Complex dynamics and control
- Spacecraft subsystems
- Aerodynamic optimization
- High-fidelity modeling and simulation
- Mission design and multi-disciplinary engineering

I enjoy solving open-ended problems, collaborating with teams, and developing systems that have a tangible impact in the real world.


My Goals

As I grow as an engineer, I aim to:
- Work in aerodynamic design, stability & control, or flight sciences
- Contribute to aircraft, UAV, or spacecraft development programs
- Improve aerodynamic efficiency and stability through innovative design
- Support mission design and modeling for next-generation aerospace systems
- Build technologies that improve reliability, efficiency, and sustainability in flight
- Ultimately, my goal is to be an engineer who builds systems that make flight safer, cleaner, and more capable.


Beyond Engineering

Outside of academics and projects, I’m someone who enjoys a mix of creativity, community, and storytelling:
- Music: One of my biggest sources of creativity and focus. I especially enjoy exploring different genres.
- Planespotting & Aviation Photography: I love capturing aircraft in motion — whether it’s commercial jets, regional turboprops, or military flyovers.
- Gaming: I enjoy a range of games, including flight simulators, racing games, story-driven adventures, and strategy games.
- Sci-Fi & Movies: I’m a fan of anything related to world-building and sci-fi engineering.
- Cars: I’m not a hardcore car person, but I enjoy learning about vehicle design, powertrains, and handling physics.
- Friends & Family: I value spending time with the people close to me — whether that’s relaxing, exploring new places, or just hanging out.

These interests keep me balanced, help me stay creative, and often inform my engineering work by providing fresh perspectives and constant exposure to real-world aviation.
