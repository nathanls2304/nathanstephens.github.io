# About Me

I’m Nathan Stephens, a senior Aerospace Engineering student at Florida Institute of Technology with a strong background in spacecraft dynamics, aerodynamic analysis, and multidisciplinary engineering design. My experience spans modeling, simulation, and hands-on hardware development across controls, aerodynamics, and space systems.

Core Technical Strengths:

- Spacecraft ADCS modeling: quaternions, attitude dynamics, Lyapunov control, actuator modeling
- Computational Fluid Dynamics (ANSYS Fluent) — rarefied flow, LEO drag analysis, DSMC/Sentman theory
- Structural analysis & FEA (ANSYS Mechanical)
- Orbital decay modeling & aerodynamic stability of drag-modulation devices
- CAD & design tools: Creo, NX, Fusion 360, OpenVSP
- Software & programming: MATLAB, Simulink, C++, Python
- Systems engineering: requirements development, trade studies, design reviews, and team-based technical   projects
